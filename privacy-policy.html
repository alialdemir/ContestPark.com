    measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store your

    available to the public, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that
    information during its transmission or its storage on our systems. Further,
    while we attempt to ensure the integrity and security of our network and
    systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent
    third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining access to this information.
